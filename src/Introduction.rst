Multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria are one of the most important current threats to public health(1). 
The source of this analysis rely on an article which is called "Horizontal Tranfer of a Multi-Drug Resistance 
Plasmid between Caliform Bacteria of Human and Bovine Origin in a Farm Environment". This study follows 
different steps.First, Multi-drug-resistant coliform bacteria were isolated from feces of cattle exposed to antimicrobial agents and humans associated with the animals. Seconds, Ä±solates from both cattle and humans harbored an R plasmid of 65 kb (pTMS1) that may have been transferred between them due to selective antibiotic pressure in the farm environment(2). At the end of the study, different strain and plasmid of *Coliform bacteria* in *different Humans* and *Cows* are obtained.

In this project, we compared all plasmids with genomic DNA from **refseq** database against original plasmid which is isolated from farm environment.
